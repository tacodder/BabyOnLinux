# BabyOnLinux
This is a repo for everyone that wat to start from Zero(0) in Linux

n 2025, AI, GPUs, LLMs, and many other technologies are advancing at an incredibly fast pace 🚀. I've noticed that lacking foundational knowledge in Linux (even though I know the basics, there’s always more to learn 📚) and having intermediate skills in handling text, strings, files, and bash programming can slow down your learning process 🐢. Improving these skills can speed up your development and help you better connect your previous knowledge in Development, IT, Networking, or Data 💡.
